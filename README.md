# sql-interactive-display
 Java program that allows for simple MySQL commands.

Author: Michael Kellam

This project was created to test my basic knowledge of SQL and its commands. There is plenty of room for improvement, mainly the fact that whenever I perform an action (add,update,delete), I need to perform a query, in which I select the entire table rather than what I exactly need. But the point of this wasn't speed, rather creating a basic program that works as intended.

Due to my limited knowledges of GUI implementation, I did not quite understand how to allow scrolling through the table, so it fits the entire table into the frame. Again, this is not ideal for dealing with real large-scale databases, but for conveying its function, it works perfectly.

You may use/modify this code in any way you want. Credit to me is not required, but it is appreciated.

I would love to hear your criticism and what you think of this project! You can email me at: michaelkellammc@gmail.com
